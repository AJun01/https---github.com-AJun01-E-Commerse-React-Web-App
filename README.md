## React App: E-Commerce Platform Based On Microservices  

### Project Overview
This project is a **full-stack E-Commerce platform** that is architected using **microservices** to ensure scalability, performance, and flexibility. The platform allows users to seamlessly browse, purchase products, and manage their accounts while the back-end services manage transactions, product data, and user information.

Built using modern development technologies such as React, Node.js, Docker, and Kubernetes, this project leverages a microservice architecture to distribute various responsibilities across multiple independent services. The project also incorporates continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automatic updates.

### Project Goals
- Develop a responsive and intuitive e-commerce platform using microservices.
- Ensure scalability, high availability, and fault tolerance through the use of Docker and Kubernetes.
- Implement a secure authentication system to safeguard user information and transactions.
- Ensure data integrity and performance by leveraging a robust database management system.
- Automate the deployment process using CI/CD pipelines, enabling efficient and error-free updates.

### Technologies Used
- **Front-End:** React, Redux for state management
- **Back-End:** Node.js, Express.js, Microservices architecture
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens), OAuth
- **Containerization:** Docker for microservice isolation
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes for managing clusters
- **CI/CD:** Github Actions for automating Docker image builds and deployments

### Key Features
- Highly extensible and robust back-end built using Express.js, featuring reusable middleware and mini services.
- Responsive user interface developed with React, offering seamless integration with back-end services.
- State management achieved using Redux for efficient handling of user interactions and application state.
- Data integrity and performance are ensured through a dedicated microservice for database management using MongoDB.
- Secure authentication and authorization system implemented with JWT and OAuth, protecting user transactions and data.
- Automated CI/CD pipeline that pushes Docker images through Github Actions for a streamlined development process.
- Cluster management optimized through Kubernetes, providing improved efficiency, scalability, and fault tolerance.
